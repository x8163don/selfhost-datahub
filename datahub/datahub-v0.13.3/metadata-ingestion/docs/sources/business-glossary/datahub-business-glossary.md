### Business Glossary File Format

The business glossary source file should be a .yml file with the following top-level keys:

**Glossary**: the top level keys of the business glossary file

Example **Glossary**:

```yaml
version: 1                                     			# the version of business glossary file config the config conforms to. Currently the only version released is `1`.
source: DataHub                                			# the source format of the terms. Currently only supports `DataHub`
owners:                                        			# owners contains two nested fields
  users:                                       		    # (optional) a list of user IDs
    - njones
  groups:                                               # (optional) a list of group IDs
    - logistics
url: "https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub/"      # (optional) external url pointing to where the glossary is defined externally, if applicable
nodes:                                                  # list of child **GlossaryNode** objects. See **GlossaryNode** section below
	...
```

**GlossaryNode**: a container of **GlossaryNode** and **GlossaryTerm** objects

Example **GlossaryNode**:

```yaml
- name: Shipping                                                # name of the node
  description: Provides terms related to the shipping domain    # description of the node
  owners:                                                       # (optional) owners contains 2 nested fields
    users:                                                      # (optional) a list of user IDs
      - njones
    groups:                                                     # (optional) a  list of group IDs
      - logistics
  nodes:                                                        # list of child **GlossaryNode** objects
    ...
  knowledge_links:                                              # (optional) list of **KnowledgeCard** objects
    - label: Wiki link for shipping
      url: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freight_transport"
```

**GlossaryTerm**: a term in your business glossary

Example **GlossaryTerm**:

```yaml
- name: FullAddress                                                          # name of the term

    users:                                                                  # (optional) a list of user IDs
      - njones
    groups:                                                                 # (optional) a  list of group IDs
      - logistics
  term_source: "EXTERNAL"                                                   # one of `EXTERNAL` or `INTERNAL`. Whether the term is coming from an external glossary or one defined in your organization.
  source_ref: FIBO                                                          # (optional) if external, what is the name of the source the glossary term is coming from?
  source_url: "https://www.google.com"                                      # (optional) if external, what is the url of the source definition?
  inherits:                                                                 # (optional) list of **GlossaryTerm** that this term inherits from
    -  Privacy.PII

    - is_used_for_compliance_tracking: true
  knowledge_links:                                                          # (optional) a list of **KnowledgeCard** related to this term. These appear as links on the glossary node's page
    - url: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address"
      label: Wiki link
  domain: "urn:li:domain:Logistics"                                            # (optional) domain name or domain urn

## Generating custom IDs for your terms

IDs are normally inferred from the glossary term/node's name, see the `enable_auto_id` config. But, if you need a stable 
identifier, you can generate a custom ID for your term. It should be unique across the entire Glossary.

Here's an example ID:
`id: "urn:li:glossaryTerm:41516e310acbfd9076fffc2c98d2d1a3"`

A note of caution: once you select a custom ID, it cannot be easily changed.

## Compatibility

Compatible with version 1 of business glossary format. 
The source will be evolved as we publish newer versions of this format.
