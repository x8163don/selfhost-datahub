### Setup

The artifacts used by this source are:

- [dbt manifest file](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/artifacts/manifest-json)
  - This file contains model, source, tests and lineage data.
- [dbt catalog file](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/artifacts/catalog-json)
  - This file contains schema data.
  - dbt does not record schema data for Ephemeral models, as such datahub will show Ephemeral models in the lineage, however there will be no associated schema for Ephemeral models
- [dbt sources file](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/artifacts/sources-json)
  - This file contains metadata for sources with freshness checks.
  - We transfer dbt's freshness checks to DataHub's last-modified fields.
  - Note that this file is optional â€“ if not specified, we'll use time of ingestion instead as a proxy for time last-modified.
- [dbt run_results file](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/artifacts/run-results-json)
  - This file contains metadata from the result of a dbt run, e.g. dbt test
  - When provided, we transfer dbt test run results into assertion run events to see a timeline of test runs on the dataset

To generate these files, we recommend this workflow for dbt build and datahub ingestion.

```sh
dbt source snapshot-freshness
dbt build
cp target/run_results.json target/run_results_backup.json
dbt docs generate
cp target/run_results_backup.json target/run_results.json

# Run datahub ingestion, pointing at the files in the target/ directory
```

The necessary artifact files will then appear in the `target/` directory of your dbt project.

We also have guides on handling more complex dbt orchestration techniques and multi-project setups below.

:::note Entity is in manifest but missing from catalog

This warning usually appears when the catalog.json file was not generated by a `dbt docs generate` command.
Most other dbt commands generate a partial catalog file, which may impact the completeness of the metadata in ingested into DataHub.

Following the above workflow should ensure that the catalog file is generated correctly.
